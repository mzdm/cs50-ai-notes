Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) covers a range of techniques that appear as sentient behavior by the computer. For example, AI is used to recognize faces in photographs on your social media, beat the World’s Champion in chess, and process your speech when you speak to Siri or Alexa on your phone.

In this course, we will explore some of the ideas that make AI possible:

Search
Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move.

Knowledge
Representing information and drawing inferences from it.

Uncertainty
Dealing with uncertain events using probability.

Optimization
Finding not only a correct way to solve a problem, but a better—or the best—way to solve it.

Learning
Improving performance based on access to data and experience. For example, your email is able to distinguish spam from non-spam mail based on past experience.

Neural Networks
A program structure inspired by the human brain that is able to perform tasks effectively.

Language
Processing natural language, which is produced and understood by humans.
